IMPORTANT
====================
The new version (RPly 1.1) now supports 64bit systems. I imported the new
version. As the 64bit support was the major difference between librply and the
old RPly version almost all modifications became obsolete.

### So this is now merely a copy of RPly 1.1 with some additional examples and
 ## Makefiles. The “important” code is the same as on the original RPly
  # homepage.

ABOUT
====================
RPly: ANSI C Library for PLY file format input and output 

RPly is a library originally written by Diego Nehab, that lets applications
read and write PLY files. The PLY file format is widely used to store geometric
information, such as 3D models, but is general enough to be useful for other
purposes.



COMPILATION
====================
For compilation of the library simply call
% make

Furthermore you can create some example programs by calling
% make test
